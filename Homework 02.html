<!-- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

                <br>
                <p>Audio Engineer looking to make the transition into the world of coding and web development. I've been in the music industry for almost a decade, gotten to work on some iconic projects and am very blessed, even got a GRAMMY! But after stubling upon a mindset, fitness, and nutrion program, I learned that flow state > everything else... even music! So from now on I'm trying to create what allows me to just live there at all costs. And to share with others what has worked for me. As the journey continues Im turning to software engineering. Dont exactly know all the details yet but its OK! The path is illuminated as we walk it.</p>
