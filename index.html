                <br>
                <p>Audio Engineer looking to make the transition into the world of coding and web development. I've been in the music industry for almost a decade, gotten to work on some iconic projects and am very blessed, even got a GRAMMY! But after stubling upon a mindset, fitness, and nutrion program, I learned that flow state > everything else... even music! So from now on I'm trying to create what allows me to just live there at all costs. And to share with others what has worked for me. As the journey continues Im turning to software engineering. Dont exactly know all the details yet but its OK! The path is illuminated as we walk it.</p>
